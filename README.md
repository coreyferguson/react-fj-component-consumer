### **react-fj-component-consumer** is a component made to consume(test) react-fj-component.

Clone the repository from github through git clone.

We can consume it in two ways right now:

1. Node
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `npm install react-fj-component` installs react-fj-component under node_modules. We can then simply import the component and use it with ReactDOM to render it. 


2. Browser
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `bower install react-fj-component` installs react-fj-component under bower_components. We can then simply import the component and use it with requireJS.

>Demonstration of both ways is given in the react-fj-component-consumer. Further explanation is given in index.html file.
